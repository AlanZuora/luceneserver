better handling of renamed issues

are we getting dup suggestions w/ rename?

org.this.that is not splitting into tokens!!

lucene smoke doesn't highlight lucene in suggestions?

remove isDev/prod/isMike?

NRT is failing to show new comments?

grep through production logs for exeptions!

why does "bens" make bogus suggestions?

search for 7462 SHOULD have found LUCENE-7174, like it does in production now
